protobuf: protobuf (Google's data interchange format)
protobuf:
protobuf: Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
protobuf: serializing structured data, think XML, but smaller, faster, and
protobuf: simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once,
protobuf: then you can use special generated source code to easily write and
protobuf: read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams
protobuf: and using a variety of languages. You can even update your data
protobuf: structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled
protobuf: against the "old" format.
