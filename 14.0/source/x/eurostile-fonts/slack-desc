eurostile-fonts: Eurostile is one of the most important designs from the Italian font
eurostile-fonts: designer Aldo Novarese. It was originally produced in 1962 by the
eurostile-fonts: Nebiolo foundry as a more complete version of the earlier 
eurostile-fonts: Microgramma, a caps-only font designed by Novarese and A. Butti.
eurostile-fonts: Eurostile reflects the flavor and spirit of the 1950s and 1960's.
eurostile-fonts: It has big, squarish shapes with rounded corners that look like 
eurostile-fonts: television sets from that era. It works well for headlines and small
eurostile-fonts: bodies of text.
