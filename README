This repository contains everything it needs to build and install the
Slackware-based Microlinux Enterprise Desktop (MLED).


Introduction
------------

The Microlinux Enterprise Desktop is a full-blown production desktop based on
the latest stable Slackware Linux release and Xfce. It is currently used by
various small town halls, public libraries and schools in South France. 

MLED is *not* some derivative distribution. It consists of a collection of 136
custom packages installed on top of an unaltered Slackware base system. It
focuses on the Xfce desktop environment, with many enhancements. 

A selection of carefully integrated applications are featured, one per task.
Elegant and sober artwork fit for use in a corporate environment is also
included. A complete selection of codecs, plugins and fonts provide a seamless
desktop experience. Intuitive and user-friendly default settings and menu
entries are provided. 

The Microlinux Enterprise Desktop runs reasonably fast on ten-year-old
hardware. A battered first-generation Pentium-IV with 512 MB RAM and a 10 GB
hard disk will be perfectly sufficient for the job.


Credits
-------

Much of this work is really just an assembly of the great work that's been done
before by some excellent folks, and here's the place to give them credit:

  * Robby Workman for his excellent work on Xfce
  * Eric Hameleers for his "impossible" SlackBuild scripts ;o)
  * Daniel de Kok, who worked on the initial scripts back in 2006
  * All the crew from SlackBuilds.org for their really precious work
  * George Vlahavas from the Salix distribution, a fine Slackware spin-off
  * And of course, Patrick Volkerding for creating the "Finest Linux Anywhere"


Installation
------------

The following step-by-step instructions assume you already know how to install
a vanilla Slackware desktop. You will need a working internet connection.

The Microlinux Enterprise Desktop installs on top of a carefully selected
Slackware base. In order to avoid painstakingly picking each package, the
recommended method is to use the provided set of tagfiles. 

Boot the Slackware installation DVD (or the first CD). Select your keyboard
layout, login as root and partition your hard disk, but don't start the
installer yet.

Bring up your network interface, for example:

  root@slackware:/# dhcpcd eth0

The Slackware installation environment already sports an empty '/tag' directory
for a set of tagfiles, so let's use it.

  root@slackware:/# cd /tag

Grab the set of tagfiles from the server:

  root@slackware:/tag# wget http://www.microlinux.fr/tagfiles/MLED-14.0.tar.gz

Unpack the downloaded archive:

  root@slackware:/tag# tar xvzf MLED-14.0.tar.gz

Clean up:

  root@slackware:/tag# rm -f MLED-14.0.tar.gz README

Your '/tag' directory should now contain a series of directories corresponding
to the Slackware package sets:

  root@slackware:/tag# ls
  a/ ap/ d/ e/ f/ k/ kde/ kdei/ l/ n/ t/ tcl/ x/ xap/ xfce/ y/

Now start the Slackware installer:

  root@slackware:/tag# setup
 
PACKAGE SERIES SELECTION: accept the default package selection, since the
tagfiles will override this and take care of selecting each package anyway.

SELECT PROMPTING MODE: 'tagpath - Use tagfiles in the subdirectories of a
custom path'

Path to tagfiles: '/tag'

USE UTF-8 TEXT CONSOLE: 'Yes'

CONFIRM STARTUP SERVICES TO RUN: accept the default selection

SELECT DEFAULT WINDOW MANAGER FOR X : 'xinitrc.xfce' 

  -> This choice is of no consequence, since user profiles already contain the
  relevant '~/.xinitrc' file.


First reboot
------------

Fetch scripts and configuration files:
  
  # cd /usr/share
  # svn co svn://svn.tuxfamily.org/svnroot/microlinux/slackware

On 32-bit Slackware :

  # cd slackware/14.0/slackware

On Slackware64 :

  # cd slackware/14.0/slackware64

Fetch all Microlinux Enterprise Desktop packages (roughly 500 MB):

  # ./get-MLED.sh

Install all MLED packages in one go:

  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new */*.txz

Now you'll probably have to adjust your environment variables in
'/etc/profile.d/lang.sh'. Default variables are set to fr_FR.UTF8, since MLED's
main use is in France:

--8<---------- /etc/profile.d/lang.sh ----------------------------------------
export LANG=fr_FR.utf8
export LC_COLLATE=fr_FR.utf8
--8<--------------------------------------------------------------------------

English-speaking Slackware users will use something like this:

--8<---------- /etc/profile.d/lang.sh ----------------------------------------
export LANG=en_US.utf8
export LC_COLLATE=en_US.utf8
--8<--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reboot.


Further configuration
---------------------

On Slackware64, now's the time to install the 32-bit compatibility layer
provided by Eric Hameleers : 
  
  # cd ../multilib/
  # get-all.sh
  # cd 14.0/
  # upgradepkg --reinstall --install-new *.t?z
  # cd slackware64-compat32/
  # upgradepkg --install-new *-compat32/*.t?z

Configure 'slackpkg'. Edit '/etc/slackpkg/mirrors' and choose one and only one
mirror according to your geographical location, for example:

--8<---------- /etc/slackpkg/mirrors -----------------------------------------
...
# FRANCE (FR)
ftp://mirror.ovh.net/mirrors/ftp.slackware.com/slackware64-14.0/
...
--8<--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now blacklist all packages tagged "microlinux" to prevent them from getting
squashed by an update:

--8<---------- /etc/slackpkg/blacklist ---------------------------------------
...
[0-9]+_microlinux
--8<--------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Slackware64, you'll also have to blacklist Eric's Multilib packages:

--8<---------- /etc/slackpkg/blacklist ---------------------------------------
...
[0-9]+_microlinux
[0-9]+alien
--8<--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now update everything:

  # slackpkg update
  # slackpkg upgrade-all

Installer the MPlayer plugin from 'extra/':

  # slackpkg install mplayerplug-in

The 'user-settings-desktop' package features - among other things - the
'cleanmenu' utility, a small Bash script to clean up various desktop menu
entries and make them Joe-Sixpack-friendly. Run this utility:

  # cleanmenu

Configure the X.org server. 

  -> A note on NVidia cards. I've had some bad freezes with the 'nouveau'
  drivers on various cards, so I decided not to include these - as well as the
  legacy 'nv' drivers - in the basic package set. I recommend downloading and
  building the proprietary 'nvidia' drivers from http://www.nvidia.com. If you
  don't want to use the 'nvidia' driver, you can still grab the
  'xf86-video-nouveau' or 'xf86-video-nv' packages using 'slackpkg'.

The Microlinux Enterprise Desktop uses the SLiM login manager. Edit
'/etc/rc.d/rc.4' to launch SLiM on startup:

--8<---------- /etc/rc.d/rc.4 ------------------------------------------------
# Tell the viewers what's going to happen...
echo "Starting up X11 session manager..."

# Try to use SLiM login manager.  This comes first, because if SLiM is 
# installed, then the user probably wants to use it by default:
if [ -x /usr/bin/slim ]; then
  exec /usr/bin/slim
fi
...
--8<--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Define one or more normal users for the system:

  # adduser

Switch to default runlevel 4:

--8<---------- /etc/inittab --------------------------------------------------
...
# Default runlevel. (Do not set to 0 or 6)
id:4:initdefault:
...
--8<--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reboot and enjoy your shiny new Microlinux Enterprise Desktop.

Build MLED from source
----------------------

Installing MLED from binary packages as described above is the preferred
method. However, you can build MLED from source if you're inclined to do so.
Here's a few instructions.

  NVidia caveat
  -------------

If you have an NVidia card and you are using the proprietary driver, some
builds like wxGTK, Firefox and Thunderbird will fail. Before launching the
build, uninstall the proprietary driver: 

  # ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-304.64.run --uninstall
 
Then, reinstall the 'mesa' package:

  # slackpkg reinstall mesa

  JDK tarball
  -----------

Before launching the build, go to http://www.oracle.com and download the JDK
tarball for your architecture:

  * jdk-7uXX-linux-i586.tar.gz for 32-bit Slackware
  * jdk-7uXX-linux-x64.tar.gz for 64-bit Slackware

Move the tarball to source/d/jdk/.

  Start the build
  ---------------

Launch the master SlackBuild as root:

# ./MLED.SlackBuild

This master build takes care of: 

  1. downloading all sources;

  2. building packages in the right order;

  3. installing packages as they are built;

  4. storing them in the right location.

Depending on hardware and bandwidth, count a few hours for the whole process to
complete.

  Add some translations manually
  ------------------------------

Translations for Open Office are not included in the master build and have to
be built separately:

  # cd source/locale/openoffice-langpack
  # ./openoffice-langpack.SlackBuild

This builds the french language pack. The german translation can be built like
this:

  # OOLANG=de ./openoffice-langpack.SlackBuild

Convert an existing installation to MLED
----------------------------------------

Remove the cruft from '/tmp':

  # cd /tmp
  # rm -rf *

Switch to runlevel 3.
